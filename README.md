This repository includes the project my group made, some practical classes'
exercises, the theoretical classes' slides, and some of the previous years'

**Note** for the students taking the course seeing this repository: the teacher
of this class (Pedro Souto) is extremely strict when it comes to plagiarizing
the work made in previous years. If you copy anything from this repository, it
is very likely that you'll fail the class.
